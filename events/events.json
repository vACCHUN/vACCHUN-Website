Last Friday night of the month? Put your kids to bed or place them in the right seat and start your engines, as vACC Switzerland hosts a new edition of one of its most popular events at Geneva International Airport (LSGG). Let us prove to you that size is less important than skill; with a single concrete runway, our controllers face the challenge of getting the timing just right in order to clear you to land just seconds after departing traffic\u2019s gear has left the ground. Needless to say, expect late landing clearances.\r\n\r\nWaiting at the holding point? Get ready to line up behind landing traffic or perform a rolling takeoff, as there is bound to be traffic on short final waiting for that late call from Tower. \r\n\r\nWe are fully staffed and ready to get you in and out safely, one by one.
